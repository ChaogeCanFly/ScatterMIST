<h1>Modeled Integrated Scatter Tool (MIST)</h1>

The MIST program has been developed to provide users with a general application to model
an integrated scattering system. The program performs an integration of the bidirectional
reflectance distribution function (BRDF) over solid angles specified by the user and allows
the dependence of these integrals on model parameters to be investigated. The models are
provided by the <a href="https://github.com/thomas-germer/SCATMECH">SCATMECH</a> library of scattering codes.
